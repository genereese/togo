### What is Togo?
Want to create an RPM to deploy your software and don't want to spend hours learning how to do it? -or maybe you're already familiar with the process, but just want it to feel more clean and organized?

Use Togo! You can have **your first RPM** built and ready to install **in less than 5 minutes.** (Scroll down for a super-fast example.)

Who might find Togo useful?
* A sysadmin who has a script or group of scripts he wants to add to a yum repository
* Python (or other language) developers who want to package their modules into an RPM
* A developer who has pre-compiled binaries he wants to package up and install on several systems
* Anyone who wants to keep track of everything on their system(s) with RPM
 

### Quick-start Guide
#### Installation

Download and install togo using whatever method is most convenient:

##### Using yum
```
$ sudo yum install https://github.com/genereese/togo/releases/download/togo-3.0r3/togo-3.0-3.noarch.rpm
```

##### Using dnf
```
$ sudo dnf install https://github.com/genereese/togo/releases/download/togo-3.0r3/togo-3.0-3.noarch.rpm
```

##### Manual install

Clone the repo, run the build script, and install the RPM manually:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/genereese/togo.git

$ cd togo; ./build-togo.sh

$ sudo yum localinstall ./rpms/*.rpm
```

#### Configuration
Now that togo is installed, configure your name and email:

```bash
$ togo configure -n "Your Name" -e "your_email@address.com"
```

This information is only used to set the "Packager" field on any RPMs you create:

```
$ rpm -qip togo-2.0-2.noarch.rpm | grep "Packager"
Packager    : Gene Reese <gene.reese@xirsix.com>
```

### Super-Fast Example

1) Create the project directory using the script (this should be the desired name of your RPM):
```bash
$ togo project create my-new-rpm; cd my-new-rpm
```
2) Copy your files into the build root:
```bash
$ mkdir -p root/usr/local/bin; touch root/usr/local/bin/example_file
```

3) Exclude the the ownership of '/usr', '/usr/local', and '/usr/local/bin' from your RPM:
```bash
$ togo file exclude root/usr/local/bin
...
```

4) **OPTIONAL:** Modify the generated spec file to your desired version/release/summary, etc.
```bash
$ vi spec/header
```
5) Build the RPM
```bash
$ togo build package
```
-and your RPM is placed into the ./rpms directory.
